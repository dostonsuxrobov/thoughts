the pattern of effectiveness in any situation, regardless of what is thought to be "impossible" or doomed to failure, is pretty much clear.

1. identify the reality of that specific situation. the whole reality can be overwhelming, so it's better to focus on the local version of whatever is happening there. identify its fundamentals, plan, and move forward based on what works. avoid ruminating on past failures or conflicts. switch to the next step based on what is possible right now to ignite momentum. learn from mistakes and failures, but always focus on what's next. reality is the ultimate judge, and it must be respected and guided only by its rules. no other rule should be allowed except reality itself.

2. remove what is not necessary. you do not need most of the things you think you need. you need efficiency to move faster, to experiment heavily, and to remove as many points of failure as possible. this is essential for understanding the situation in the first place.

3. simplify things. communicate, be honest, direct, and use simple words. everything should follow this principle whether it's a process, system, or machine. simplicity is always better. complexity consumes more energy, reduces bandwidth, which in turn reduces intensity for focused local effort. it generally leads to a dead end where "no one knows anything, but things somehow move." that's dangerous like a car with broken brakes and no steering.

4. momentum is the most critical power of all. it creates exponential growth, which strengthens everything else. but it must come after the first three steps. it's like a high-speed car: once you push the accelerator, it moves so fast that it continues on its own. but to truly control it, first choose or build the right driving method. make it lean and simple to create a buffer so that bumps don't crash the car. this way, you can keep speeding up in a way that competitors can't keep up.

5. make sure the car can be driven even without you. check in from time to time, but the primary goal is to scale and build a system strong and scalable enough to keep moving without your constant involvement. think of it like the scientists who gave us simple formulas after decades of experimentation and mistakes—elegant solutions that can be reliably used.

when you encounter something grand, hard, or "impossible," break it down into much smaller chunks or approach it from different angles before jumping in directly. you need to see it as a step-by-step process instead of one giant leap.

hard work, commitment, or simply loving what you do all matter—but they need to be filtered through this process to become truly effective instead of wishful thinking.

all of these combined can build a fulfilling life, as each achievement feeds into the next. the brain enjoys this kind of progress, which can potentially lead to stronger and more lasting fulfillment.
