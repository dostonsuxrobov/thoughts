trying to change someone is a fruitless activity with no reward. fundamental variables cannot be moved, while cosmetic changes are deceptive.
the adult brain is mostly fixed and not prone to change unless internal desire is put in place. even in that case, it requires a lot of energy and strategic thinking, like a statesman. external efforts lead to nowhere.
for any inert state to change, energy must be applied to put entropy into order. but that very order requires agency over the fundamentals of whatever atoms you want to organize. it's impossible to have full agency over another person's fundamentals; only they can do so.
prolonged relationships with a person who is fundamentally incompatible do not yield a choice of complete change by becoming like the other person. instead, they lead to deception, exploitation, or relationships limited to transactional nature.
the more you open up, the more vulnerable you become in terms of giving away your weak points. this works in both ways: on one side, you can attract people who will exploit, deceive, or use those weak points to attack—just as military history shows. at the same time, you can attract like-minded people who are fundamentally aligned with you.
fundamentally misaligned people cannot thrive together. they end up deceiving each other through efforts to change over time, but this is misguided. society works without such depth because transactional relationships function at macro levels, but that is not the kind of depth needed in close relationships. depth can only be created by fundamental compatibility—not with every single atom aligned, but with a few key points where people agree completely and deeply. values that stay alive for a long time, or forever. everyone has them, but not all consciously know them, which leads to clashes with others or choosing the wrong relationships.
agency over the fundamentals can make things feel magical or superhuman. that's how great people built history. but individual humans cannot be moved the same way. women thinking they can change their husbands, children thinking they can change parents, boyfriends seeking to change girlfriends—these are all delusions. some cosmetic changes may be real, but deep fundamental misalignments lead to dead ends.
a child is possible, because while growing up, you have agency over building those foundations. it's limited but real. but with adults, it's almost always impossible.
