sometimes i try to analyze the worst and best possible conditions and ask the question: why? why are some people extremely productive while others seem stuck in a loop of constant regression.

i think it is the basic physics of things that governs everything else, more clearly described as momentum. a person does not get fat overnight or healthy overnight, or wealthy or broke overnight. it is almost always momentum, a chain of things carrying through, one on top of another. every single decision, every missed piece of feedback, or every piece of feedback that is actually used adds to that momentum.

i do not believe in overnight success or overnight failure. almost everything gives you clues and feedback along the way. you can choose to listen to them or ignore them. when you look closely into the detailed chronology of almost every company or every individual life, you find clues showing that each failure or catastrophe was preventable or avoidable, because each day provided its own set of data at each day, moment or even hourly.

indecision is mainly ignoring the feedback of life in general, while decision is mostly action taken by listening to it. i do not believe it is about stupid versus smart or angels versus evils. it is basic physics applied to life, because both ourselves and our lives obey the rules of physics.
