survival in the modern world is mostly solved. there are still some places suffering from wars, famine (mostly manufactured), droughts, or violence, but the majority of global human living conditions are good enough. by good enough i mean the availability of food and shelter. most of the remaining problems cluster around "making more" in many areas. disappointments mainly come from excessive expectations, supercharged by the bombardment of different media types. marketing companies want to sell their products, so they evangelize whatever they are selling. this evangelic look makes others perceive it as reality, which in turn creates bloated expectations. those expectations then feed disappointment, stress, or even depression when reality does not fit the modeled map in the brain.

most survival needs are solved. most of the human population does not face problems such as tigers eating children or climatic mass starvation. we no longer live in caves, at least for the majority of the population. 
although flawed, we have systems in place that govern the modern world through currencies, some degree of stability through beliefs, incentives, interests and scientific growth.

it is both the best and worst time to be alive depending on how oneâ€™s brain is mapped. it is a great time to be depressed about everything, as the world can give ample reasons for it. slavery in the modern world is more tied to credits, loans, luxury, or never-ending expenses, which one tries to maintain in order to look good by matching the expectations of ghost audiences and competing against delusional perfection.

there is also another alternative, which does not look as "fun" or straightforward. it may even seem boring, but it is a path of fulfillment. it comes from bringing growth into life through risks, exploration, and building. this is a great time for that since our baseline survival is in place. a person with a failed startup can start again as long as they are not enslaved by large loans, debts, or destructive biological habits or illnesses. the fact that companies can survive without profit for years shows they have the potential to bounce back in very large numbers, although not guaranteed. the point is not to embrace profitless companies but to be fascinated by the increasing freedom of choice.

one path looks nicer, richer, with more friends and "fun." the other looks boring, risky, and intense. interestingly, each side disregards the other. while it is true that some people try to do both, i believe individuals still tend to tilt in one direction. it is not about which path is better. it is about choosing one and having the discipline to live in it with all its tradeoffs. trying to sit at two tables at once makes you fail at both. picking one brings body and brain alignment, which can give peace, meaning, and even fulfillment or happiness when done right, something that basic food or shelter alone cannot provide.

the common substance is totalizing optimization. both the dedicated "dancer" and the dedicated "builder" have organized their entire life system around a single, primary goal.

the "dancer" optimizes for immediate social validation and sensory experience. decisions about money, time, and energy are all funneled toward maximizing this output. sacrificing long-term financial health for a status object or an experience is a logical choice within this optimization framework.

the "builder" optimizes for a long-term, abstract goal. decisions about money, time, and energy are funneled toward making progress on that goal. sacrificing immediate social opportunities or comfort for more work time is a logical choice within their framework.

the reason people who try to balance them often fail is because they are attempting to serve two opposing optimization functions. it is energetically and cognitively inefficient. the builder's need for deep, uninterrupted focus is directly at odds with the dancer's need for constant social engagement and novelty. choosing one path provides a clear, coherent filter for making decisions. without that clarity, energy is scattered and dissipated.

that is the reason i believe a person needs to make a choice consciously based on tradeoffs. as the new world will not kill any of them, since survival needs are mostly covered, the point is about making the choice early enough and being at peace with all its sides. nothing is perfect in this constrained universe. and when you push an object (the "action"), that object simultaneously pushes back on you with an equal force in the opposite direction. it requires energy to align and sustain the action, especially when aiming to compound it over time. trying to balance them all is ineffective. choosing a specific path brings peace, alignment, and compounding in whatever direction is chosen, as long as the survival variable remains intact.

in the coming years, the disparity between these two groups will diverge even more, but i do not think it will be fatal or bad. i believe it will be great, as long as we continue to survive. builders will become more able to build, while dancers will be able to dance more. with survival secured, builders will make things more efficient, available, and cheaper, while dancers will be able to afford more. both groups will gain fulfillment and happiness in their own ways and on their own terms.
