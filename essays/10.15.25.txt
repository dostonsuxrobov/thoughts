trying to be the hero in someone else's life is to mistake a movie script for a blueprint of reality. It's an egotistical and inefficient strategy for deploying your finite resources.

that is why fundamental conclusion is default at "no" to neraly everything except few which i am deeply confident and truly know that needs my energy, otherwise all others needs to be ignored.

“Hero” behavior is ego-driven misallocation.
reality rewards precision of effort, not dramatic gestures.
