There are two repeating patterns in my life.

1. Saying “no” : Each time I say no more often, my energy, time, and money increase. I can focus better on what I truly want. Helping others is valuable, but 95% of the time it brings no return. So I’ve learned to be careful with it, to protect what’s limited and respect constraints. Trying to look good or kind in others’ eyes often leads to exploitation. Yet being rude is also unwise since survival depends on cooperation. The best approach is balance, though I still lean toward saying “no” more often because its return on investment is too clear to ignore.

2. Sleep : Nothing has improved my life more than quality sleep. A disciplined schedule supported by the right diet has made it automatic. I no longer need to force myself to sleep or wake up; my body does it naturally. That means “step 5” in my book list is achieved. The happiness of life depends heavily on sleep quality, it either compounds positively or becomes debt overtime. I choose the positive compound of this non-negotiable resource.
