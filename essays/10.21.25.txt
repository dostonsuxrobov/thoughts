i believe many of the businesses truly go bankrupt not because of competition or even "bad luck," but rather due to their internal state. it's like countries, if a country is weak internally, in most cases it will also be weak internationally. strong internal cohesion, military, and economy can make that country dominant and respected without any theater, interventions or conquests abroad. even on the individual level, a smart, good-looking, or active person is usually a healthy one, and that health often comes from disciplined routines.


efficiency itself is not a predictor of success, but it's an enabler of survival. exponential growth requires long-term survival combined with a high speed of learning, ideally driven by real-world feedback loops which needs mistakes + failures along the way. that's the best way to predict who will survive long enough to reach escape velocity. when high achievers mention grit or resilience, it's not necessarily a matter of willpower, but rather the efficiency of the internal system that realistically keeps the survival threshold low enough to sustain the loop, not just the leader's mood.

survival is a math problem. cut burn, compress cycle time, increase signal quality. over enough shots, luck averages out and solvency compounds.
