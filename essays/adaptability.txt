it's critical to know that we don't know everything. even with high-end simulation machines or perfect mathematical probabilities. this makes risk necessary, but adaptability fundamental.

it's easier to stay ultra-adaptable when a person is in healthy shape with a financially low burn. basically, staying healthy through daily exercises, a simple food, a strict sleep schedule, and occasional fasting helps unlock a lot of energy for maintaining agility and clarity. at the same time, a low cost of living — or spending without excess — helps increase savings. these habits increase efficiency without clutter and improve focus on the things that matter.

i have some small rules for myself, which i try to instill through repetition:

no regrets or sentimentalities that can hold the mind back from acting productively.

no bullshit bureaucracies, bloat, or "generational wisdom" — everything must be crash-tested. only working ideas should be allowed and adopted quickly.

no notion of "honor" or other ideological constraints without clear reason. when survival is at stake and every decision matters, relying on delusional ideals is counterproductive.

learn, seek advice, search, watch, google, prompt — do anything to get to the root and change the variables based on that. never stick to rigid rules or "supposed to be." nothing is permanent. always get to the root and align the variables accordingly.

adaptability is not an excuse for millions of fallback plans. there should be one plan A and no other. evolution should remain the north star — or the direction should change entirely. adaptation is about changing tactics, not the vision itself.

examples:

Elon Musk – GA4 tent line, Fremont, June 2018
in early 2018, Tesla was collapsing under its own promises. Elon Musk had committed to building 5,000 Model 3s per week but couldn’t get past 2,000–3,000 using standard factory lines. conventional automotive timelines said expanding capacity would take months or years. instead, Musk broke every rule in the manual: he ordered the creation of GA4, a new general assembly line built inside a giant tent in Tesla’s parking lot.
the entire line — 300 meters long — was erected in just six weeks. it used simplified manual processes, low-cost conveyors, and skipped robotic systems that were causing bottlenecks. by 30 June 2018, Tesla hit its target. the GA4 tent wasn’t just a workaround — it showed that vertical integration and speed-driven improvisation could outmaneuver legacy processes in modern industry. Musk’s decision saved Tesla from what could have been an existential failure.

Joseph Stalin – GKO evacuation order, 16 August 1941
in mid-1941, Hitler’s operation barbarossa shattered Soviet defenses. German armies stormed across the USSR, threatening to capture 80% of Soviet industry, concentrated in the west. the Soviet state faced collapse. on 16 August 1941, Joseph Stalin signed the GKO order to evacuate over 1,500 factories east of the Ural Mountains — a logistical move without precedent.
entire industrial plants were disassembled, loaded onto trains, and moved thousands of kilometers, often under Luftwaffe attack. workers were relocated with families; factories were rebuilt in open fields. by 1942, tanks, planes, and artillery were rolling off new lines in Siberia and the Urals. the move reversed a death spiral, turning the Soviet Union from disarray into a war machine. Stalin’s gamble — abandoning geography for depth and production — was brutal, efficient, and decisive.

Napoleon Bonaparte – battle of Marengo, 14 June 1800
the battle of Marengo is the clearest battlefield proof of Napoleon’s real-time adaptability. expecting a retreating Austrian force, he misjudged — and was attacked by surprise. for most of the day, Napoleon’s army was losing. French lines collapsed, units retreated, and even his best generals were outmaneuvered. by mid-afternoon, the battle was nearly lost.
but Napoleon held the field just long enough for General Desaix to arrive with reinforcements. seizing the narrow window, he reorganized surviving units, launched a sudden counterattack, and used concentrated artillery under Marmont to strike the overextended Austrians. the enemy broke. the battle, lost at noon, was won by dusk. Marengo didn’t reflect a perfect plan — it showed instant, fluid adaptation to failure, chaos, and opportunity.

Lee Kuan Yew – August 1965: rebuilding a nation from collapse
when Singapore was expelled from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, it was an unplanned, humiliating break. Lee Kuan Yew’s entire strategic bet — economic and political union — evaporated. the new state had no army, no food security, no natural resources, no water independence, and two million restless people in racial tension. most leaders would have panicked. Lee immediately redefined the nation’s purpose.
he shifted from regional dependence to becoming a global city-state. within weeks:
signed long-term water and trade treaties with Malaysia
secretly invited Israeli advisors to build a national army
accelerated public housing to eliminate slums and control unrest
opened the door to foreign multinational corporations, offering order and cheap labor
Lee didn’t mourn the loss. he pivoted completely, building Singapore not as a compromised leftover but as a functional, efficient, and globally connected city-state. within five years, GDP surged and the model took hold. his response to 1965’s crisis is one of the cleanest modern examples of political and economic re-adaptation under real existential threat.

counter examples:

Mikhail Gorbachev – USSR collapse, 1991
Mikhail Gorbachev inherited a crumbling Soviet system, but instead of rebuilding it from first principles, he applied partial fixes. his glasnost and perestroika reforms unlocked public frustration but left the core system — centralized economic planning — intact. he permitted open speech but kept the Communist Party monopoly. he relaxed repression but didn’t build institutional alternatives. when national republics demanded autonomy, he stalled. when the economy froze, he didn’t liberalize fast enough. his refusal to decisively abandon Soviet orthodoxy created political paralysis, economic collapse, and finally, disintegration. in just six years, the USSR — the largest state on earth — ceased to exist.

Tsar Nicholas II – Russian monarchy collapse, 1917
by the early 20th century, Tsarist Russia was a medieval structure inside an industrializing world. Nicholas II ignored the writing on the wall — widespread poverty, landless peasants, and an emerging middle class demanding reform. after the 1905 revolution, he granted a Duma but stripped it of power. during world war i, he insisted on leading the army himself — and took personal blame for failure. as cities starved and soldiers mutinied, Nicholas clung to divine-right monarchy and repressive policing. by February 1917, his system collapsed almost overnight. the empire imploded not because of enemies — but because its ruler refused to adjust to a modern world.

Kodak – ignored its own digital camera, 1975–2012
in 1975, Kodak engineer Steve Sasson built the first digital camera prototype. management shelved it. why? they feared it would kill Kodak’s lucrative film business. through the 1980s and 1990s, Kodak doubled down on film, ignoring digital trends and assuming brand power would shield them. even when digital sales exploded globally, Kodak underinvested in new formats, released half-hearted products, and stayed loyal to old business lines. by the 2000s, it was too late. in 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy. a company that pioneered the future died protecting the past.

Nokia – fall of the mobile phone giant, 2007–2013
when Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, Nokia’s response was arrogance. still the world’s biggest phone maker, it laughed off the idea of touchscreen-only devices. Nokia stuck with Symbian OS, which was outdated and hard to program. engineers internally warned of the threat, but leadership dismissed them. by the time Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, Android and iOS had taken over the market. Nokia’s product cycles, organizational silos, and refusal to rebuild its OS and UX from scratch killed it. by 2013, Nokia was out of the phone business. a tech empire vanished by defending obsolete tools.

BlackBerry – missed the smartphone pivot, 2007–2016
before the iPhone, BlackBerry dominated business smartphones. but it misunderstood the game. it thought secure email and physical keyboards were unbeatable. when the iPhone and Android phones arrived, with apps and media-rich UX, BlackBerry executives scoffed. they kept pushing enterprise security and incremental updates. their touchscreen models were clunky and late. the world shifted to mobile platforms and ecosystems — BlackBerry stayed locked in a hardware mindset. it lost both consumer and enterprise markets. in 2016, it exited phones entirely. a symbol of productivity, undone by inflexible thinking and cultural arrogance.

Blockbuster – killed by streaming, 2000–2010
in the early 2000s, Netflix approached Blockbuster to sell itself for $50 million. Blockbuster laughed them out of the room. why bother with DVDs by mail? Blockbuster had 9,000 stores, late fees, and brand dominance. but as Netflix pivoted to streaming, Blockbuster stuck to real estate and outdated rental models. it tried a half-hearted mail service too late. it couldn’t shift its business model, couldn’t kill late fees, and couldn’t imagine a world without stores. in 2010, Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy. it died because it believed the future had to look like the past.

Yahoo – death by indecision and internal chaos, 2000s–2017
Yahoo was once the gatekeeper of the internet. but it never decided what it really was — media company, tech platform, or search engine? it passed on buying Google for $1 million. bought Flickr and Tumblr, then mismanaged them. failed to innovate in mobile or search. internal infighting and constant CEO changes (over six in a decade) paralyzed direction. while Google, Facebook, and Amazon focused and scaled, Yahoo spread itself thin. by 2017, it sold its core assets to Verizon. it had traffic, brand, and capital — but no adaptability, no focus, and no second act.

General Motors – industrial dinosaur, bankruptcy 2009
in the postwar era, GM was a global titan. but it got addicted to SUVs, gas guzzlers, and bloated internal bureaucracy. it ignored consumer demands for quality, fuel efficiency, and tech integration — especially as Toyota, Honda, and VW advanced. labor contracts grew unsustainable, innovation slowed, and costs ballooned. when the 2008 financial crisis hit, GM couldn’t adapt. it was buried under debt, excess inventory, and obsolete product lines. in 2009, it declared bankruptcy and was bailed out by the u.s. government. GM didn’t die from market pressure — it died because it refused to evolve.
