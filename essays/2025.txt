human destiny is a shifting target; every action, thought, and piece of knowledge shifts its trajectory. the true beauty of life is the fact that it lies in my own hands, in my "free will" granted by the divine. i have the power to achieve greatness or bring my own downfall. 


while the vastness of the universe may make me feel small and powerless, my primary role is not to alter the spin of the solar system but to contribute to the progress of humanity. my task is to take the baton from previous generations, move forward tiny bit, and pass it on to those who come after me.

i was born in a post-soviet central asian country shaped by its conservative ideology, which deeply affected my family. the mix of collective ideals and multiple societal crashes left its mark on the people and my family alike. managing a large family came with its challenges—differences in perspectives, insecurities, alcoholism, abuse, neglect, generational gaps, unresolved conflicts, financial struggles, transactional relationships, corruption  and outright ignorance. these were all byproducts of a massive social experiment that failed catastrophically in the 1990s. it wasn’t just my family; similar issues were widespread, a reality created by the scale of the collapse—a reality people had to adapt to. i don’t blame my family. they faced their own challenges, struggled with their inner demons and external pressures, which they simply didn’t know how to manage. i have no reason to complain. instead, i am grateful for the resilience this environment helped me build, accelerating my maturity beyond my years. i am thankful for the system that provided me with education and experiences that i deeply value and aim to improve upon. rather than expressing gratitude in words, i believe it’s more meaningful to contribute through my actions. by taking concrete steps to support and uplift those around me, i can show my appreciation. i am blessed with these responsibilities and grateful for the experiences that have shaped my path. i have yet to become the person i strive to be, but i am willing to walk that path toward growth and betterment.


i am mortal, and i accept this truth; i have made peace with it. knowing that i will die one day brings me both relief and energy. it is an incredible reminder that i have only one chance to live—to be genuinely useful to my fellow humans, to live a truly fulfilling life, and to contribute, even in a small way, to advancing human civilization.

i have made tremendous mistakes and experienced a few triumphs over the past 26 years. looking back, i see only valuable lessons, as i firmly believe that my destiny can only be shaped when i learn the lessons the ecosystem intends to teach me. whether it was emotional turmoil, isolation, separation, misunderstandings, quarrels, ignorance, being taken advantage of, or family estrangement, each served as a vital lesson and knowledge necessary to build my path forward. i consider myself blessed to have faced both adversities and opportunities since childhood, for which i am both grateful and cautious. grateful as they taught me much, cautious because i matured fast but lacked empathy with some basic emotional intuition which i guess was shut down by my brain to protect me. whatever it is, i need to work on it, to make it better.


i am grateful because my father’s alcoholism gave me a powerful example of the consequences of addiction. his emotional imbalance and unresolved insecurities taught me to be mindful of my own. my mother’s negligence instilled in me the strength to be independent, and their combined disowning granted me complete freedom to carve out my own unique path in life.


i built relationships with strangers from different paths, nationalities, religions, cultures, and colors. each time, i wanted to create a new version of a family unit, but i didn’t realize they were already a part of me—my own chosen extended family. every time i think about it, i feel blessed, as each of them is closer to me than my own biological family. their near-unconditional love still warms my heart, and the moments we shared are priceless. these fragmented moments with my closest "strangers" are what i call "family." my friends are closer to me than my own brother, the people i work with are more supportive than my father, and coworkers who might seem distant are more caring than my mother. every conversation with my friends brings deep understanding, care, and love. their support is beyond words. i have been blessed with people who were supposed to be "strangers," but their genuine love has kept me alive. one day, i hope to build my own family.


every relationship i built with women failed, not because of them but because of me. Shahzoda loved me, she even admitted it openly, but i ignored her. why? i wasn’t ready to take responsibility—I had nothing to offer, and it felt delusional. Kamola; brilliant, smart, pretty, and we understood each other well, but we couldn’t build anything. why? i couldn’t provide for her—I didn’t even have money for the bus, let alone for supporting a family. Gavhar; the most beautiful among them, smart, and loved me beyond imagination. we dated for a long time, and she was even willing to wait years for me. but i ended it after two years. why? i was terrified i couldn’t provide for her or for potential children. i couldn’t imagine bringing an ethnically uzbek girl to my parents or exposing her to the occasional alcoholic drama from my father. it was painful, like a deep cut, but i had to do it—for both her and myself. i believe it was the right decision. Mahbuba; creative, emotional, and one of the most independent people i knew. she was a living breathing inspiration. but it didn’t work. why? i was too busy pursuing a US visa, my education, and raw work. more importantly, i lived in a dormitory—what could anyone expect? Dilorom; probably the most compatible with me in terms of ideology and intellect, but it couldn’t work either. she is in Tashkent, and i am in the US. the distance is too great. even now, when i have the resources to provide, the question is—where? could i return to Uzbekistan for her and restart life in tashkent? no. being closer to my parents is a nightmare. Oisha ; young, emotional, and deeply committed. she impressed me by fully reading my long messages and inspired me with her religious thoughts. but i ended it too. why? we couldn’t be together in Samarqand. Maria was mature, good-looking, and caring. though our relationship was more transactional, our feelings were mutual. still, it couldn’t work because i couldn’t provide enough. every relationship of mine had financial constraints. yet, every girl was willing to accept me for who i was. ironically, i wasn’t ready to accept myself. i loved each of them, but i ended things because i couldn’t let them endure the suffering of the path. this was my path, and i chose to walk it alone. i don’t regret my decisions. i’m proud that i made choices that were painful but right—for them and for me.

unresolved issues i've ignored for so long: delusional fantasies about some grand event where everything "perfect", proving to my parents that i'm "worthy of their admiration." this was basic escapism from reality, rooted in the belief of those fantasies, it was clearly unrealistic and wrong. 
a misguided search for role models led to mistakes, including becoming overly dependent and developing people-pleasing tendencies. i hate remembering times when i idolized others as "perfect" or tried to mimic their tastes, even when they didn’t suit me. it was not only wrong but also felt inauthentic and ugly.  seeking external validation and misunderstanding of others’ motives: i used to think the more you help, the more people like you, and being liked equated to being a better person. i was wrong. everyone has their own lives, and i’m barely a fraction of their thoughts. their opinions reflect their unique experiences and values, which have nothing to do with me. they don’t really care about me, and that’s okay. instead, i should focus on the small number of people who truly matter—my "chosen family." these are the people who chose me for who i am, whom i trust and want to be trusted by. they are few, but they are the ones whos care and attention truly enough for me.
my desire to bring my family back together by achieving "greatness" is misguided. i am not a cosmic accident that suddenly made their lives worse. i am not the cause of their perceived pain, financial struggles, my father's alcoholism, or my mother's illness. i have not done anything intentionally to hurt them. i am not their enemy, yet somehow, i ended up being treated like one. for a long time, i grieved with guilt over this, not knowing who to talk to, so i turned inward, to the books. there, i found peace and solitude. i’ve come to understand that i am not the reason for their circumstances, nor can i be the catalyst for their change. trying to fix it might only make things worse. a pivot is necessary—i must change myself, apart from those burned bridges, without complaints, grudges, or regrets. i have no other choice but to move forward. 
my understanding of my own pain and the process of healing: for a long time, i didn’t know what was happening to me. i numbed myself with cheap dopamine, gained weight, became aggressive, incompetent, and lost direction. i neglected my health to the point of nearly dying in the hospital. i didn’t realize that the roots of my struggles were far deeper than i imagined, and only i could heal them. so, i’ve chosen to go deep, bringing those buried issues to the surface to confront them, i have deleted all my social media, decluttered my life, started to eat healthier, live simpler, move more, workout consistently and read more, thankfully, they are working. my acceptance of my pain is making me stronger. my growing understanding and knowledge are helping me heal, forgive, and move forward.

at first, i thought religion could help me—help me heal, find the right path, and become a better person. i was wrong. i failed to see the intricate motivations of these institutions, their true desires, and their attempts at manipulation. i’m grateful i’ve grown enough to see the difference between human made religion and god. thankfully, i’ve matured enough to choose the latter. 
in moments of utter desperation, when i had nothing left—no food to eat—a friend called me with a job opportunity at "Buyuk Kelajak." that job paid me enough to survive for months. if not god, then who? when i first arrived in New Hampshire as an imigrant, i walked a long path through the forest in an entirely unfamiliar place with no internet connection or enough battery power to guide me. i was lost and scared, but in the middle of the night, someone found me and led me in the right direction. if not god, then who? during the time i had no proper immigration status, no job, weak health, and no way to pay rent during covid, i was offered a job that allowed me to survive for the next three months. if not god, then who? when i was driving for the first time and couldn’t get a driver’s license in New York, i got into a car accident in Pennsylvania. my Hyundai Sonata 1999 was totaled, i had no insurance, but i was safe, and the other driver was safe, with their Land Rover completely undamaged, the driver was nice enough to just let me go, if not god, then who? 
in every critical moment, when i was desperate, god helped me. it had nothing to do with human made religion and everything to do with god himself. i am grateful, i am humbled, and thankfully, i have survived.

with the arrival of a new age, i need to set myself on a new path to shape my destiny for the decades ahead. i must initiate an upward trajectory on an exponential curve. what began as a dream—3d animation—once seemed out of reach, but now feels like the right direction, with a new pivot, game development emerges as the perfect combination of systems thinking, coding, simulations, animations, and design. it aligns seamlessly with my broader goal of building technology companies as a solopreneur. starting with game engineering can serve as my entry point into technology, paving the way through ai and robotics to accelerate my vision of creating companies, research labs, and factories powered by automation. 
however, ai and robotics are not guarantees of prosperity; they are merely tools that can be leveraged to achieve it. the foundation lies in building my character from the ground up, cultivating a strong mindset inspired by the qualities of great individuals who came before me and live today. their leadership and methodologies must be adapted to my personal framework, rather than blindly copied. my "software upgrades" need to align with my unique "biological hardware." this is where inner drive becomes invaluable. only through an internal push can i move forward. the inner world is my only truly unlimited resource, and the only person i can rely on at any moment is my inner self. nurturing this inner self is essential—because it can either make or break me. the choice is mine, and i choose to thrive. 
optimistic pragmatism must become my new foundation. an action-oriented mindset, fueled by near-delusional self-confidence and an unlimited internal reservoir of hope, resonates deeply with me. i admire those who speak little but do a lot more. such individuals are rare but appear as giants in my eyes. this pragmatic mindset helps strip away unnecessary emotional noise, discern the fundamental truth, and act upon it. in a world filled with negativity, hatred, gossip, and excessive emotions, pragmatism grounded in foundational optimism is a relief and only the most effective way to move forward. 
i can figure out what to do even in situations that seem to have no solutions because i trust in god, i know that god is always with those who truly need him. work brings pure joy to the heart, but focused work is the only path to lasting fulfillment. concentrating on a small number of bets  and improving their chances of success is the best approach, as spreading resources too thin can lead to failure. even Napoleon fell because of this—let it serve as a cautious reminder. Napoleon is an inspiring figure, not just for his spectacular rise but also for his catastrophic fall. there is much to learn from both.

constant development of the prefrontal cortex and improving my biological governance is the foundation of nearly everything. it enables commitment at a biological level, strengthens resistance to urges, sharpens thoughts, enhances self-control, and builds fundamental self-confidence. it unlocks the potential for productive, independent thinking driven by internal motivation, fostering strong focus and unwavering confidence.
embrace humility through daily small actions: sit and sleep on the floor, avoid overeating, eat once a day, consume simple and earthly meals, fast occasionally, clear your thoughts, help others, be kind yet formidable, and don't allow yourself to be pushed around by anyone. let people leave if they choose, hold no grudges, and stay true to your ideals every single day.
the right balance of calmness and urgency is essential. there’s no room to slow down unnecessarily, but desperation isn’t the answer either. my calm nature is an asset; i must pair it with a pragmatic mindset to maintain this balance and move forward efficiently. 
learning anything is possible if you truly care. the brain is a powerful learning machine. while some people may learn faster, speed is not the most important factor—focus and consistency are. attitude is ten times more valuable than talent or birth privileges, as head start is meaningless without sustained momentum. 
let actions speak louder than words. let ambitions run wild, but anchor them with strategic steps, keeping the ego grounded in humility toward others and myself. remember: it’s okay to build transactional relationships—they have their own value. accept that not everyone will like you, and that’s fine. everyone is motivated by their own needs and desires, and they may need something from you. this is not a flaw but a hallmark of being useful. it’s the essence of mutual support and fulfillment. we all a creations of god on earth created to support one another.

balance of incremental progress and "ripping the band-aid off" for an exponential path: stay consistent with your actions, overcommit to your chosen path, but be prepared to pivot quickly when necessary and ripp the band-aid off when necessary. you will suffer, and it will be excruciating—but that’s okay. some pain is the ultimate testament to progress, this is how it tastes like. it’s better to endure short-term suffering for lasting fulfillment than to drown in fleeting dopamine, only to face long-term regret for a life not fully lived.
muscles grow through gradual weight increases, the brain strengthens through repeated rehearsal and disciplined learning, strategies emerge from simple, clear, and focused intensity on high-conviction bets. these principles may seem easier to say than to practice, but focus becomes more natural over time. prioritize bets where the loss is 1x but the upside can be 100x. focus on these, as the right 20% of effort can transform the remaining 80% of your life. choose a clear and meaningful vision, concentrate on it with intensity, and trust that everything else will fall into place.


what i should not be doing and why: raw horsepower without a healthy body is a bad tradeoff. hard work brings true joy to the heart, but my body is a gift from god. to truly experience this joy, my body needs to be healthy. to be kind, i need sufficient quality sleep. to protect my loved ones, i need to exercise. to smell good, think clearly, and make good decisions, i need to eat natural foods. to live long, i need to fast. these are simple, actionable steps with immense benefits—100x returns to every aspect of my life.
suffering and pain: what to endure and what to avoid: not all suffering is equal, and it’s critical to know the difference. some pain is worth enduring, while some must be avoided. Shackleton endured unimaginable pain to save his crew, Musk soldiered through it to build groundbreaking companies, and Putin endures it as he rebuilds one of the largest nations on earth. however, not all pain leads to growth—some are destructive. Steve Jobs’ ignorance of his health led to his early death. Napoleon's neglect of health lead to his downfall, my own neglect of my health brought me close to death. my disregard for quality sleep made me unproductive and cost me my job. choose wisely. human life is inherently filled with pain and suffering, but the task is to endure the right kind—the kind that makes you useful, that builds a better future where the next generation endures less.
i need to shut down my search for a partner until i achieve my fundamental objectives, to avoid repeating past mistakes. every man’s role is to provide, protect, support, and be a shoulder to lean on. if my desires are only temporary, it’s better to suppress them. i want a strong, lasting family—not fleeting encounters. it’s better to remain celibate than to waste time with meaningless relationships. 
talk less—no one truly cares anyway. don’t show off; people recognize your worth through your actions, not your promises or possessions. while perception has value, substance always outweighs form. avoid speaking badly about others or gossiping. every negative word harms you more than the person you’re talking about. although danger can energize, negativity, even when based on facts, is counterproductive. stay positive and hopeful, no matter the circumstances. if things don’t work out, pivot or fail forward—there’s always a way, i can figure it out.
 
don’t get trapped by short-term success or the pursuit of quick money that doesn’t bring long-term fulfillment. the path of short-term thinking is riddled with traps. almost every "quick win" is a scam, every magician or fortune teller deceives, short-form content wastes massive amounts of time, and quick "antidepressants" like drugs, alcohol, or unchecked aggression have devastating consequences. even sweets come with their own side effects. always think long-term. remember that everything compounds—both the good and the bad. the choice is mine and these choices shift my destiny from one way to another. read long books, allow yourself to engage with boring but necessary tasks, work intensely on a focused path, sleep on time, eat unsweetened, drink plain, talk less, be brutally honest, and help more. 
don’t teach—learn, don’t pretend—become, don’t complicate—oversimplify. don’t try to be someone else—be yourself. plan for decades, commit to seconds, and dream big. trust that you can achieve everything once all the parts are aligned. don’t give up until luck turns in your favor.
when a human asks for something from god, god responds with, "do you really want it?" and, "if yes, prove it." everything i wish for can be achieved as long as i have a proper answer to these questions. what i receive might not be exactly what i asked for, but that’s okay—honestly, i don’t fully know what i want myself. i do, however, have an idea, a dream, a vision. this vision is always a moving target, but at its core, the platonic ideal remains constant, even as the methods or details evolve. trust myself, trust god, and trust that i can figure it out along the way.

don’t fight fundamental principles. learn them, search for them, and exploit them, but don’t try to break them.
don’t stop people from burning bridges; if they want to, you can’t prevent it anyway. don’t look back either—keep moving forward. destiny is a moving target, and so are the people in it. don’t try to teach, change, or manipulate others unless they want it themselves; you can’t force them. history shows the devastating consequences of doing so.
don’t get personal while criticizing. focus on the output of the work or process, not the person. don’t point fingers; if someone betrayed you, it means you allowed it or let your emotions cloud your judgment.
not everything is as bad as it seems, not everything is as good as it seems, and not everything is as risky as it looks. trust data, fundamental knowledge, and patterns, not appearances.
don’t try to understand every person or every word; most people don’t fully know what they want. don’t get bogged down by complexities, manipulations, or emotions. get back up and keep moving forward.
before consuming information, understand the motivation behind the source. before listening to criticism, separate the noise from emotions and decide whether to act on it or not.
this year will be pivotal. not because i know everything, and i’m not claiming to be the smartest or wisest, but this year has taught me tremendous lessons. i am still learning and hope to continue doing so until my last breath. this year, i tested multiple ways, paths, and approaches on myself. i saw progress in some areas and failures in others. like a researcher seeking solutions, i studied myself and histories of formidable people. i was blessed with loneliness and hardships that helped me discover the right way forward. i’ve found some answers and am ready to act on them in the coming year.
a single year may not make a huge difference on its own, but it can set the foundation for exponential growth, ignite momentum, and build the strength to sustain it. it’s a chance to start living fully, become truly useful, and achieve sovereign independence. one year of going all in—dedicated to forging a path toward an interesting and fulfilling life as a useful individual.
i can, i trust, i am ready, i am willing, and i will—no matter what it takes.

there will definitely be tradeoffs. i can’t have everything at once, and my energy is not unlimited. i need to focus maximum effort on a small number of high-conviction bets. i might feel lonely, i might get lost, i may lose people, and there will be times i would not know next step. it will undoubtedly be painful in many ways—I will suffer. i might become too rigid or miss some "chances," but these tradeoffs, and others i may not yet foresee, are worth the path i’ve chosen.
how will i deal with the worst-case scenarios? Mike Tyson said, "plans work until the first punch to the face," and there’s a lot of truth in that. but as the saying goes, "it’s better to have a bad plan than no plan." like Shackleton, Musk, Napoleon, or Putin, i will adapt, figure things out, learn, and keep moving forward. pivoting is always an option, as long as i stay true to my vision of sovereignty.

what to expect for the decades ahead and why i am more optimistic and confident than ever: i have stronger confidence in myself than ever before. i know what i don’t know, and i trust my ability to figure it out. my humility, calm demeanor, work ethic, discipline, and pragmatic nature are my greatest assets. i’m ready to use, develop, and build upon them, personalizing the methods of my heroes to forge my own unique path.
the future holds incredible potential. the next generation of companies will heavily rely on ai and robotics. the most nimble and fast-growing companies will be those that can scale up or down based on demand quickly, conduct rapid research, iterate quickly, and deliver more with less. solopreneurship is a powerful model for this new era—where single individuals can own research labs, factories, and companies powered by automation, ai, and robotics. such sovereign individuals will drive economies forward, create immense value, solve complex challenges, and improve lives globally.
each year, the potential for individuals to achieve more is growing. the lines between massive corporations and single-person-led ventures are blurring with the emergence of opportunities in every domain of life.
i want to be part of this. i know i can. i believe i am capable. i don’t know if i will succeed, but the excitement of pursuing this vision fills me with joy and energy. simply knowing that i’m taking steps toward it makes me feel useful and gives my life a sense of worth.

i deeply respect Shackleton, Musk, Napoleon, and Putin. they are my heroes, but i am not them, and they are not me. i can learn from their lives, adapt some, and create my own version of a “better life,” my own version of “humble greatness,” and my own version of a “worthy life.”
