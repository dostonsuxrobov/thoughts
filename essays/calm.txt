staying calm is not about passivity or relaxation in some remote tropical island but rather a mechanism of giving more space for the brain's prefrontal cortex to function than your ancient amygdala. it's about keeping urgency, bold pragmatism, and intensity of focus with a calm face.

strategic paranoia – it is about thinking of the worst things first, assigning them probabilities, and either building contingencies or buffers, or psychologically being at peace with them. it prevents shocks, provides some preparedness if they happen, and fosters acceptance of constraints when powerless to change the outcome. for example:
–- in the book "Mind of Napoleon", he mentioned his three pillars: constant action, concentration of strength, and acceptance of being able to perish or simply being dead—on the battlefield. he basically thought about the worst possible outcomes, slightly exaggerating them, which made him appear calm in the midst of real, brutal battles. he could think clearly and give orders calmly while grapeshot flew in all directions under the real threat of decapitation. this often inspired his troops, seeing their commander so composed. surprisingly, his own life wasn't always like that, he was emotional and at times erratic but when it came to military strategies and moments of crisis, he would change.
i love history because it gives the results of actions, methods, and consistent patterns without the real cost in my own life. it's basically free advice from crash-tested case studies implemented and paid for by others. i don't judge them morally; i try to extract more of the systemic or mechanical patterns that worked or failed consistently. battle-hardened calmness with contingencies in mind is one of them.

acceptance – we know today a lot more than anyone in ancient civilizations, but not everything. chance still plays a large role in our lives, and we do not yet understand all the physics needed to fully engineer our outcomes. misfortunes, unexpected events, or things beyond our control can make a person feel bad, but it's should not as its not always our fault,it's simply how life works. a great part from the book "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius is the idea of accepting things not under our control, while focusing on what actually is. accepting things as they are and letting go of what is not within our direct control is the best way to free bandwidth for what matters, reduce cortisol release, and give more power to the prefrontal cortex for rational next steps. for example:
–- if a person is alcoholic, drug addicted, or has any irrational habit affecting their quality of life and they know it, it's almost certainly fruitless to try to change it externally. such behavior comes from the inside out, not outside in. external variables in these cases are too weak to move the needle in meaningful ways compared to internal ones.
–- if you grew up in an obviously dysfunctional family that uses guilt as a currency of control, you don't need to blame fate, gods, or life for it, or even try to change them extermally. just accept the fact that you have what you have, and most of the variables don't work or are simply too weak with no return on invested effort. let it go, accept it, and focus on other things.
–- if markets shift and all your efforts go to waste, no amount of strategic thinking can prevent it. in 2022, i raised some money to build a mining cluster in the raw basement of a trucking company warehouse. i set up electricity, combined all the GPUs, connected them, established a link to mining pools, and started mining Ethereum, it was the only one bringing real profit per electricity spent at that time, with a dream of potentially building a decentralized bank one day. but Ethereum team decided to remove all middleman operations, and their decisions made my efforts worthless overnight. i was devastated, but i learned my lesson and simply accepted it. no amount of variables can beat the role of chance sometimes, so i made peace with it.

lowest expectations and moonshot ambitions – ambitions should always be as high as possible, with their only constraints being survival as the floor and physics as the ceiling. the rest is a matter of time, iterations, resources, and focus. at the same time, expectations should be kept low. the reason is simple: the higher the baseline of expectation, the higher the chances of shock, disappointment, paralysis, and, most importantly, loss of resilience. things are almost always imperfect, difficult, and rarely work on the first try. this makes resilience critical for self-sustaining progress, as exponential growth requires time and a consistent level of input long enough until it becomes “obvious,” often appearing as an “overnight success.” for example:
–- if you think you are smart, it hurts when someone challenges your idea, even though feedback is critical. the baseline of expectations could block an obvious lever of progress.
–- if you think you're special, it hurts when someone even points out a gap in your values, let alone when you lose in competition or when another player simply outcompetes you.
–- if you expect that you’ll always be winner because you come from the best family, went to the best school, and had everything one could think of, it could mean your baseline is so high that your work needs to merely maintain that baseline, leaving no room for actual growth/fulfilment. this type of character is most prone to breaking, as it's relatively easy to do in an environment that constantly changes and a reality that does not care about anyone.
–- if you want to build a business or make money through building, be ready: things almost never work as expected. if you want quick results, you’ll be devastated when your hard work isn't proportionally celebrated, appreciated, or even accepted, let alone paid for. high expectations in such cases are critically counterproductive. low expectations, on the other hand, like being ready to take the punches, go through iterations, and learn from each mistake and failure with a calm mind, allow the prefrontal cortex to do its job: building synapses in the brain and enabling the market for distribution, adoption, and trust. all of this takes time and a lot of trial and error, with a high premium on the speed of learning.
–- if you are a romantic with the highest expectation of finding the perfect partner, it's doomed to fail. every individual is a biological being, and every biological being has its own flaws, shaped by nature’s adaptation mechanisms. this doesn’t make anyone bad or good, it’s simply how we, as humans, work. none of us are perfect, but any of us can build, and that is the best feature of being human. reality is different for everyone, and mostly it's a result of survival adaptation or simply the brain wiring shaped throughout life. trying to change anyone is perhaps the most fruitless activity in the universe.

brain is simply a pattern and prediction system – expectations are the brain's way of predicting rewards. when the expected reward isn't achieved, the brain releases cortisol. it feels like something is threatening, similar to what a hunter-gatherer would have felt after missing a prey, where survival was at stake due to missed food and the high risk of death. but that’s not the case in the 21st century. the brain hasn't fully caught up with modern reality, so prediction errors can cause deep emotional pain by triggering dips in the reward circuitry.
some people, in response, indulge in cheap reward activities, food, drugs, screens, that damage the biological body, even though the brain receives its dopamine "hit." this is why the question of meaning is critical, but at the same time, expectation management is paramount. when managed well, these two can increase subjective pain threshold and, when paired with meaning, allow the brain to assign rewards even in the face of real productive difficulty. for example:
–- Ottoman Empire sultans enjoyed near unmatched levels of comfort and power in history. one might think they had access to every earthly pleasure imaginable, but i doubt their brains experienced it that way. when the brain is constantly bombarded with rewards, it stops being sensitive to them. this becomes the new baseline, and anything below it begins to feel painful. even at their peak, sultans still wanted more, more power, more land, more resources, because they were still biologically human. as the empire grew in complexity, these desires became harder to satisfy. history shows how some lived in constant paranoia; some were executed publicly due to hubris, while others drank themselves to death. this, i believe, is a clear example of humanhood. as biological beings, we are not built for permanence. everything around and within us is in constant motion, striving to maintain homeostasis. this means there is no absolute misery or absolute pleasure. every extreme eventually destroys. so, the idea of eternal hell or eternal heaven is false.
–- most businesses don’t shut down because of external variables, although those do matter, they fail mostly due to internal struggles. and when people fail, most don't come back, even though their odds of success are usually higher the next time. this is often because their expectations were so high that when things didn’t work, their dopamine response crashed, like falling from a skyscraper, which caused psychological suffering like me in 2021, even when their survival was never truly threatened. by trying and failing, they actually increased their logical odds of success, but their mindset and baseline expectations prevent them from getting back up and trying again. this happens often, not just in business, but across many areas of life.

no one knows everything completely – our brains crave predictable and certain answers, but those don’t exist. scientific knowledge is the best we have, mainly because it's iterative and subject to constant change and improvement over time, which drives real progress. this is unlike religious doctrines, which claim to have all the answers to the complexities of life.
uncertainty should not discourage anyone from making choices or doing useful things. things will never be certain, so calculation, iteration, or simply being bold helps a lot, as long as these risky experiments are survivable.
–- Karl Benz built the patent, Motorwagen and patented it in 1886. he focused on engineering and was hesitant about real-world experimentation. on the morning of august 1888, Bertha Benz slipped out of Mannheim with the Motorwagen No.3 and her two teenage sons, Richard and Eugen, heading to her mother’s house in Pforzheim. the one-way trip was about 100–106 km, following wagon tracks. she did this without Karl’s prior knowledge to prove the car’s real-world value. the trip became a live field test. they faced frequent stops for fuel (ligroin, bought at pharmacies), boiled-off water, a slipped leather belt, and worn brake linings. Bertha improvised roadside repairs, using a garter to plug a fuel leak and hairpins to clear a blocked fuel pipe. the pharmacy in Wiesloch is now honored as the “first filling station” because she refueled there. Karl was a smart engineer, while Bertha was a bold pragmatist who figured things out along the way.

make more mistakes, fail more, take punches, and learn fast – direct exposure always gives the best feedback, as it's most aligned with reality and quickly reveals the gap between abstract beliefs vs how things actually work. the critical component is survival. it’s obvious that if you're able to survive such extreme, direct exposure, your body learns on systemic levels. it’s not just the prefrontal cortex involved in such scenarios, but also your muscles, hormones like adrenaline, and every other part of the body, all of which heighten focus, so the whole being absorbs the lesson on an intuitive level.
this is why survivable risks can make a person much stronger: they come to know reality with every fiber of their existence. it normally takes time for knowledge in the brain to be fully digested into the body. just saying you want to be fearless, disciplined, bold, or an early riser doesn’t make it real overnight. it takes time, effort, punches, mistakes, failures, and eventually real victories for the body to internalize those traits on a deeper level and that, again, requires direct exposure.
breaks, cracks, punches, mistakes, failures, shame, anything that affects not just the brain’s frontal cortex but also the entire system is bound to be learned deeply, because every fiber is involved, not just neural synapses. and this principle doesn't apply only to humans but to any system. the key is that it must be survivable, and data must be collected. otherwise, it's not adaptive strength, it’s just stupidity or suicide.
–- spaceX is the best example. the company follows an incremental and calculated approach, not blind brutality. it runs staged tests, accepts hardware failure, and protects people while iterating fast. Grasshopper, which began as low altitude hops and self-landings in 2013, gradually became the stepping stone for much larger rocket landings. Falcon 9’s landing success came after several iterative attempts and telemetry-driven fixes. the first ground recovery happened in december 2015.

fundamentals – these are a set of axioms considered ground truths that everyone agrees with. for example, basic facts like: every human needs food and shelter to survive, reproduction is necessary to continue lineage, earth has gravity, the number π, or the speed of light is constant. there are countless such simple fundamentals, and they can serve as a perfect model upon which deeper thought can be built.
most ideologies, morals, religions, or any “should be” systems are simply mixtures of someone’s incentives, old order building rules, or things that once worked somewhere but were never questioned afterward. people often hold onto them because they “mysteriously work,” though usually in bloated and outdated ways. this is harmful in many ways. old ways often trade efficiency for stability. while stability once mattered most, today we urgently need efficiency for the sake of our planet, for companies to truly add value, and for growing the overall economic pie instead of playing zero-sum games.
to do more with less, we need to think from the ground up, not by seeking abstractions or the so called wisdom of elders, but by focusing on atomic rearrangement: how to shuffle atoms or bits in ways that yield the most with the least. this requires both focus and ignorance at the same time. focus on the things that matter most to you, give them your utmost energy, and ignore the rest, you are not a God, so don’t even try to be. instead, do your best to be useful. this requires cutting through fundamentals and ignoring bloated thinking that exists only for shiny display. by looking at the world like people of the stone age, seeing it as if it were new, we can rebuild it for everyone, using our constrained energy in the most focused way possible.

rational self talk – people can’t copy brain maps, and most communication methods like language, speech, writing, or pictures are inefficient. this naturally leads to misunderstandings, making being misunderstood almost the default state. the brain also has limited energy, and explaining something complex to someone who doesn’t actually care is often a waste of time, their brain will biologically reject it while you waste yours. this is why, during exponential progress, listening to others’ doubts is harmful, especially if they don’t align with measurable metrics. compounding requires time and consistent effort, which means results are mostly invisible and dry for long periods. in such times of fear, doubt, or negative rumination are common, it’s more effective to redirect thoughts through rational and logical self talk rather than trying to suppress them.
–- just today i had a moment at the park. i was casually walking when i noticed a fallen tree trunk across a river, serving as a narrow bridge. it was too thin to cross comfortably, yet both tempting and terrifying. i tested it from the safe side by walking a little. my heart was pumping hard, but i talked myself through it by logically explaining the mechanics, ensuring the strength of the tree, and visualizing the worst possible scenario. this lowered my fear, gave me more focus, and allowed me to cross the bridge one step at a time, while enjoying the adrenaline.
–- when i was a child, i was always afraid of the dark. once at school, my teacher told me that darkness is simply the absence of light. logically, this meant everything i saw during the day was still there at night, the only difference was that my biological eyes couldn’t detect it without light. this simple explanation put me at ease, and i stopped fearing the dark.
most things are not as risky or fearful as we imagine, our minds often exaggerate them to protect us.

the final part is about our ultimate finish line: death, there are multiple ideas about what happens after this event, but i don’t know anyone with credible evidence who can tell me or even guide me about what truly happens after. so i place it in the box of unknowns.
the critical point is that we all die, regardless of how we live, regardless of who we are, and regardless of what good or bad we do. so i choose to build my own script, to walk an unknown path of usefulness, filled with uncertainties where no one has the answers, with adrenaline pumping in my chest, with excitement that i’m doing it anyway. it’s a path filled with moments of mistakes and failures, where i seek data to learn and improve with speed, and where the ultimate internal fulfillment is that i built my own life—and died anyway.
accepting death is the ultimate calm. it’s the last thing anyone can do anything about. it can come at any time, in any moment, whether you're prepared or not. sometimes i think about this deeply and simply accept it. this gives me a strange and powerful peace, a system-level peace that lets me live life on my own terms, at least for the time i have.
