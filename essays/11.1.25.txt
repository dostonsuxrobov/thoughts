the state, company, child, or even oneself.

if you don't take time consistently to understand the fundamental axioms, they shut down and become more like a black box functioning and operating but without clear understanding of how.

only when a person knows the details, or ideally the fundamentals, can they affect the outcomes. without consistent, focused learning and input, they deviate and become like a separate, somehow functioning system that is hard or even impossible to understand, let alone affect or steer.

that is why it's better to have one child but give consistent attention and care; one company where you can build a sustaining monopoly; or only a few fundamentals where you have enough bandwidth to focus with enough intensity to shape the outcome in the right way. efficiency does not work for its own sake, but rather for using what you have most effectively, instead of asking for more. even historical analogies of smaller armies defeating much larger ones are simply a testament to how critical efficiency is on nearly any scale.
