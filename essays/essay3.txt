for me, the only true misfortune is death itself. everything else can be solved as a task, through steps mentioned in "task.txt", or deleted, as outlined in "algorithm.txt". it might seem simple, but there's no need to make life complex—anything can be simplified. we don't have unlimited time on earth, and our bodies have an expiration date. this fragile existence can be disrupted by something as small as a bacterium invisible to the naked eye. so, it's not worth spending time on negativity or, worse, regrets.

do not fall into the cycle that makes everything worse. don't be the reason for your own downfall, even if you feel like the most misfortunate person on earth—there is always a way.


what is happiness? it's when the brain rewards us with biochemicals like serotonin, dopamine, endorphins, and oxytocin. three out of four of these are completely under our control.

serotonin can be produced simply by imagining good scenarios or by forcing yourself a smile even for no reason. this signals the brain that you're feeling good, which it reinforces through biochemical production.

endorphins can be generated through exercise. daily activity makes the body stronger in target areas—for example, strength exercises build muscles while cardio improves heart health. even walking can be seen as a passive exercise that signals the brain to produce chemicals supporting overall happiness.

dopamine can be produced by completing daily tasks. any difficulty level suffices, as long as you set a goal and break down complex tasks. this not only trains your brain to adapt quickly but also stabilizes the production of reward chemicals.

oxytocin is more social. it depends on support, acceptance, or genuine conversations. if you have no one, try being useful to any living beings: help strangers, say kind things, give advice on platforms like Quora, or contribute to open source. these actions can also trigger it.

the brain fundamentally doesn't care where signals come from—it cares about the signals themselves. as long as we understand how to trigger them, we can build a self-sufficient, independent, happy life without relying on luck or external factors beyond our control. this isn't advice to isolate yourself, but rather to take control of what you can, and let go of what you can't. the only way to truly contribute to the larger human family or bring good into the world is to carry that good within yourself. you can't make anyone even a little happier without being happy yourself. individual happiness can be engineered—even if you're sitting in a dungeon filled with rats you still can find happnies, while nothing can help you if you don’t take that step yourself, even if you live in the wealthiest castle surrounded by every luxury imaginable.

Marcus Aurelius stated, "you have power over your mind – not outside events. realize this, and you will find strength."
