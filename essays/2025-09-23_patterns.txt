Elon Musk

1. build buffer - build room for mistakes.
Alignment: Strong. Musk's entire approach to rocket development at SpaceX was built on the expectation of failure. He budgeted for the first three launches of the Falcon 1 rocket, fully anticipating they might not succeed. He told his team he only had enough money for three attempts, stating, "if we couldn’t do it in three, we deserved to die". This philosophy of embracing spectacular failures as part of the process—what employees called "rapid unscheduled disassemblies"—is a core tenet of his iterative design method: "Move fast, blow things up, repeat".

2. focus on levers - 10% variables effects 90%.
Alignment: Strong. Musk consistently seeks out the fundamental variables that can cause a seismic shift in an industry. His "algorithm," a five-step engineering mantra, is designed to find these levers by questioning every requirement, deleting unnecessary parts, and simplifying processes. At Tesla, he seized on the idea of a "Gigapress," a massive die-casting machine that could produce a car's entire underbody as a single piece, replacing 70 different parts and revolutionizing the efficiency of the assembly line. For SpaceX, the central lever was making rockets reusable, a singular focus that he believed was "the holy grail for making humans a space-faring civilization".

3. iterate with feedbacks - you build what you measure.
Alignment: Strong. Musk is obsessive about real-time data and rapid iteration. During the Model 3 "production hell," he had screens installed throughout the Fremont factory that tracked the real-time output of every workstation. He would physically "walk to the red"—going to any station where the light turned red to indicate a problem—to get immediate feedback and solve the issue on the spot. For the development of Tesla's Full Self-Driving, he decreed that the key metric was "miles per intervention," and demanded it be the first slide at every meeting to guide the team's progress.


How to Breakthrough
1. right problem - "if solved, it could be big" way of thinking.
Alignment: Strong. This is the foundational principle of Musk's career. As a young man, he created a life vision based on what he felt were the most critical problems affecting humanity's future: "the internet, sustainable energy, and space travel". This thinking directly led to the creation of Tesla (sustainable energy) and SpaceX (space travel). He told his friend Adeo Ressi his mission was to "make mankind a multiplanetary civilization," a problem so large that his friend's reaction was, "Dude, you’re bananas".

2. p = f/a - concentrated energy
Alignment: Strong. Musk’s management style is defined by "surges," where he applies overwhelming, concentrated force to a single problem. During the most critical phase of the Model 3 ramp-up, he moved into the Fremont factory, sleeping under his desk to lead a 24/7, "all-hands-on-deck" push. When facing delays with the Starship rocket, he ordered 500 employees from his other facilities to fly immediately to the Texas launch site, telling his president, "This is not a volunteer organization... Get them here now".

3. resilience - survive long enough to see the results.
Alignment: Strong. The biography is a chronicle of Musk's extreme resilience. After the third consecutive failure of the Falcon 1 rocket, with the company's existence on the line, he gathered his devastated team and gave them a simple order: build the fourth rocket and launch it in six weeks. He followed this with a public statement: "I will never give up, and I mean never". His first wife, Justine, attributes this trait to his traumatic childhood, stating, "He learned to shut down fear".


How to Be Rich
1. bigger, cheaper, simpler - attracts more people.
Alignment: Strong. This perfectly describes the "secret master plan" Musk wrote for Tesla in a 2006 blog post. The strategy was to "enter at the high end of the market, where customers are prepared to pay a premium, and then drive down market as fast as possible to higher unit volume and lower prices with each successive model". At SpaceX, he used first-principles thinking to make rockets radically cheaper by bringing manufacturing in-house and simplifying designs. "Simpler" is a core part of his engineering algorithm: "Simplify and optimize".

2. hard to copy - slows rivals.
Alignment: Strong. Musk builds competitive moats through manufacturing innovation. He believes that designing "the machine that builds the machine" is as important as designing the car itself. Tesla's Gigafactories, Gigapresses, and in-house battery production are all vertically integrated processes that are extremely difficult for legacy automakers to replicate. At SpaceX, the development of reusable rockets created a technological and economic advantage that competitors, including Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, struggled for years to match.

3. distribution - let others know.
Alignment: Strong. While Musk famously avoids paying for traditional advertising, he is a master of generating his own distribution. He cultivates a celebrity persona, becoming the real-life inspiration for the movie character Tony Stark (Iron Man). Most significantly, he uses his Twitter account as a direct and powerful channel to the public, a "flamethrower for the thumbs" that allows him to shape narratives, announce products, and engage in public battles, all of which generate massive media attention.


How to Be Strong
1. low expectations, high energy - survival is a floor, physics is a ceiling.
Alignment: Strong. "High energy" is Musk's default mode. The "low expectations" component is reflected in his clear-eyed assessment of risk. He fully expected the first SpaceX launches to fail and planned accordingly. This acceptance of failure as the baseline (the floor) allows him to take massive risks to push the boundaries of engineering (the ceiling), such as supercooling rocket fuel to a point that terrified his engineers, just to gain a few percentage points of efficiency.

2. focus on raw truth - build based on solid base.
Alignment: Strong. This is the essence of "first-principles thinking." Isaacson notes that Musk addresses problems by "drilling down to the most fundamental tenets of physics". The first commandment in his "algorithm" is to "Question every requirement" and to trace it back to the actual person who made it, not just a department, in order to challenge its validity from the ground up.


3. welcome reality - allow mistakes, failures, ignorance, imperfection, "bad luck" or any data to align.
Alignment: Strong. Failure is treated as a data-gathering exercise. After the first Starship test flight ended in a massive explosion, the control room erupted in applause, and Musk declared the day a success because of the vast amount of information they learned. He also demonstrates this in his personal life. After his then-girlfriend Grimes defeated him in the strategy game 

Polytopia, he became furious, but then stayed up analyzing the game to understand the mechanics of his loss, incorporating the data from his failure to improve.


Napoleon

How to Do Things
1. build buffer - build room for mistakes.
Alignment: Strong. Napoleon was a master of logistics and operational flexibility, which created buffers. His greatest organizational innovation, the corps d'armée system, is a prime example. Each corps was a self-contained mini-army with infantry, cavalry, and artillery, capable of fighting on its own for a time but designed to support the other corps. This structure provided a massive operational buffer; if one corps was unexpectedly engaged, another could march to its aid, turning a potential disaster into a decisive victory. He always kept a powerful strategic reserve, most famously his Imperial Guard, which he would hold back in battle as his ultimate buffer, committing it only at the decisive moment to shatter the enemy or rescue a failing flank.

2. focus on levers - 10% variables effects 90%.
Alignment: Strong. Napoleon's entire strategic philosophy was based on identifying and exploiting the most critical lever: the enemy's "center of gravity." He would seek to achieve a decisive battle that would politically cripple his opponent, rather than getting bogged down in minor skirmishes. His signature strategy, the manoeuvre sur les derrières (maneuver on the rear), involved pinning an enemy army with a small force while the main body of his army swept around its flank to cut off its supply lines and communications. This single maneuver (the lever) would make the enemy's entire position untenable, often forcing them to fight at a massive disadvantage. The Ulm Campaign is a textbook example where this maneuver led to the surrender of an entire Austrian army with minimal fighting.

3. iterate with feedbacks - you build what you measure.
Alignment: Strong. Napoleon was obsessed with gathering real-time intelligence ("feedbacks") to adapt his plans. He had an army of spies and scouts, and he relied heavily on cavalry screens to probe the enemy's strength and location. He was known for his coup d'œil—his ability to glance at a battlefield and instantly grasp the tactical situation. At the Battle of Austerlitz, he famously saw the Allies weakening their center to attack his right flank. Recognizing this feedback, he iterated his plan on the spot, ordering a massive assault on the now-weakened Pratzen Heights, which split the Allied army in two and led to one of history's greatest victories.

How to Breakthrough
1. right problem - "if solved, it could be big" way of thinking.
Alignment: Strong. Napoleon consistently focused on the biggest problems imaginable. He didn't just want to be a successful general; he sought to reorganize post-Revolutionary France and, eventually, all of Europe. His most enduring "breakthrough" was not military but administrative: the Napoleonic Code. Before him, France was a chaotic patchwork of feudal laws. He solved this "big problem" by creating a single, logical, and unified legal code that guaranteed religious liberty and equality before the law. It was so revolutionary that it remains the basis of civil law in dozens of countries today.

2. p = f/a - concentrated energy
Alignment: Strong. This principle is the very definition of Napoleonic tactics. His core belief was in concentrating overwhelming force at a single, decisive point (masse de décision) while the rest of his line held the enemy in place. He would use his artillery to relentlessly pound a chosen weak spot in the enemy's line. Once it began to buckle, he would unleash his reserve forces in a massive column, applying immense pressure (P) to a small area (A) to achieve a breakthrough. This was the tactic he used to devastating effect at battles like Austerlitz and Jena-Auerstedt.

3. resilience - survive long enough to see the results.
Alignment: Mixed. Napoleon showed phenomenal resilience at times. After his disastrous campaign in Egypt, he returned to France and seized power in a coup. His most legendary act of resilience was his escape from exile on the island of Elba in 1815. He landed in France with only a thousand men and, through sheer force of personality, rallied the nation to his side and reclaimed the throne without firing a shot, leading to the "Hundred Days." However, his career also demonstrates a failure of resilience. After the catastrophic retreat from Moscow in 1812, he was unable to accept the new reality of his weakened position and refused generous peace terms, leading directly to his first abdication.

How to Be Rich
1. bigger, cheaper, simpler - attracts more people.
Alignment: Strong. This principle applies perfectly to his civic and military reforms. The Napoleonic Code was simpler and applied to everyone, attracting widespread support. He reformed France's administration, creating the Banque de France and the prefect system, which were simpler and more efficient structures that provided stability. Militarily, the corps system was a simpler, more flexible, and more effective organization than the rigid, linear armies of his enemies, allowing him to command a "bigger" and more agile fighting force.

2. hard to copy - slows rivals.
Alignment: Strong. For nearly a decade, Napoleon's military system was impossible for his rivals to copy. It wasn't just his tactics, but the entire structure of the Grande Armée, its meritocratic promotion system, the speed of its marches, and the fierce loyalty his soldiers had for him personally. It took years of repeated, crushing defeats for the Austrians, Prussians, and Russians to begin reforming their own armies and command structures to counter his methods, giving him a massive and sustained advantage.

3. distribution - let others know.
Alignment: Strong. Napoleon was a master of propaganda and managing his public image. From his first Italian campaign, he published his own newspapers and wrote the "Bulletins of the Grande Armée". These were official dispatches from the front, but they were carefully crafted narratives that exaggerated his victories, minimized his defeats, and presented him as an invincible hero to the French public. He was one of the first leaders to understand the power of shaping a public narrative to build and maintain power.

How to Be Strong
1. low expectations, high energy - survival is a floor, physics is a ceiling.
Alignment: Contradictory. While Napoleon's energy was legendary—he was famous for working 18-hour days and exhausting his staff—he completely rejected the idea of "low expectations." His self-belief was boundless, and he always expected not just to survive, but to achieve total victory. This trait, a key to his rise, became his fatal flaw. After the Russian campaign, his refusal to accept anything less than his former glory—a clear case of unrealistically high expectations—led him to reject peace deals that would have preserved his throne, ultimately leading to his complete downfall.

2. focus on raw truth - build based on solid base.
Alignment: Mixed. In his military planning, Napoleon was obsessed with "raw truth." He was a voracious reader of detailed intelligence reports and had an unparalleled grasp of geography, maps, and logistics. He built his battle plans on a solid base of facts. However, as his power grew, he insulated himself from the truth. He began to believe his own propaganda and surrounded himself with advisors who were afraid to give him bad news. His decision to invade Russia in 1812 was based on a severe miscalculation of the logistical "raw truth" of supplying an army in the vast, harsh territory, an error from which he never recovered.

3. welcome reality - allow mistakes, failures... or any data to align.
Alignment: Contradictory. This is perhaps the most important principle Napoleon violated. Early in his career, he was a master of adapting to the fluid reality of the battlefield. But as emperor, he became incapable of accepting defeat or adjusting his grand ambitions in the face of failure. After the disastrous retreat from Russia, the "reality" was that his army was shattered and his enemies were united. Yet, he refused to "welcome" this data. He raised a new army of raw recruits and fought on, convinced he could bend reality to his will. This rejection of reality led directly to the Battle of Leipzig and his subsequent exile. His entire final act, from Moscow to Waterloo, is a tragic study in a genius refusing to align with an overwhelming and unforgiving reality.



Vladimir Putin

How to Do Things
1. build buffer - build room for mistakes.

Alignment: Strong. A cornerstone of Putin's economic policy was creating a massive financial buffer against external shocks. After the devastating 1998 financial crash, he was determined to make Russia immune to such pressures. From the surging oil revenues of the 2000s, he created a Stabilization Fund, which later became the National Wealth Fund. This reserve was explicitly designed to "cushion the budget from the volatility of oil prices" and give him "greater freedom of action both at home and abroad". By 2008, these reserves had grown to nearly $600 billion, a buffer that allowed him to weather the global financial crisis far better than his predecessors.

2. focus on levers - 10% variables effects 90%.

Alignment: Strong. Putin has consistently focused on two critical levers to project power and maintain control: energy and information. He consolidated state control over Russia's vast oil and gas reserves, particularly through the state-owned giant 

Gazprom, which he used as "an instrument to project Russian power". By controlling Europe's gas supply, he could exert enormous political pressure. Simultaneously, one of his first moves as president was to seize control of the national television networks, like NTV, understanding that controlling the narrative was the central lever for ensuring domestic stability and popular support.

3. iterate with feedbacks - you build what you measure.

Alignment: Mixed. Putin has shown the ability to adapt his tactics based on feedback, but not his overall strategy. After the disastrous handling of the Beslan school siege in 2004, where public anger surged over the government's incompetence, he didn't liberalize. Instead, he iterated his approach to control: he tightened it, ending the election of regional governors and centralizing power further under the guise of strengthening the state to fight terrorism. He saw the "colour revolutions" in Georgia and Ukraine as feedback that Western influence was a threat, and he iterated by creating "a political system that would be immune to" such challenges, not by addressing the grievances that caused them.

How to Breakthrough
1. right problem - "if solved, it could be big" way of thinking.


Alignment: Strong. Putin's entire political project is a response to what he saw as the ultimate "big problem": the collapse of the Soviet Union, which he famously called "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century". His goal wasn't just to manage Russia but to solve the problem of its post-Cold War weakness and humiliation. His breakthrough vision was the restoration of Russia as a strong, sovereign great power, respected and feared on the world stage. This grand objective has been the driving force behind his actions for over two decades.

2. p = f/a - concentrated energy

Alignment: Strong. Putin is a master of applying concentrated force to achieve a decisive political or military outcome. Politically, his campaign against the oligarchs is a key example. He didn't take them all on at once; he focused the overwhelming power of the state on one target, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the head of the Yukos oil company. Khodorkovsky's arrest and imprisonment in 2003 was a "calculated act of intimidation" that sent a clear message to other oligarchs: stay out of politics, or you will be destroyed. Militarily, the 

Second Chechen War was a brutal application of this principle, culminating in the razing of Grozny to crush the separatist movement.

3. resilience - survive long enough to see the results.

Alignment: Strong. Putin's political career is a masterclass in resilience. He rose from a mid-level KGB officer in a collapsing East Germany to a key administrator in the chaotic St. Petersburg of the 1990s, surviving numerous corruption scandals and political battles. He navigated the treacherous end of the Yeltsin era to become his hand-picked successor. He has since weathered economic crises, mass protests, terrorist attacks, and international sanctions, surviving for over two decades by consolidating power and eliminating rivals, ensuring he could "survive long enough to see the results" of his project to rebuild Russia.

How to Be Rich
1. bigger, cheaper, simpler - attracts more people.

Alignment: Strong (in the context of power). Putin's primary reform was to make the state's power structure "simpler" from his perspective. He instituted the 

"power vertical," a system that centralized executive power in the Kremlin and eliminated the chaotic regional autonomy of the Yeltsin years. He consolidated disparate state-owned companies into "bigger" national champions like Rosneft. This simpler, centralized control attracted the support of the 

siloviki (security and military elites) and a public weary of chaos.

2. hard to copy - slows rivals.

Alignment: Strong. Putin's system of rule is uniquely his and extremely "hard to copy." It's a complex, informal system built on personal loyalties, a mix of former KGB colleagues and allies from his St. Petersburg days. He acts as the ultimate arbiter between competing Kremlin clans, a political balancing act that is "less a state in the normal sense than a mechanism for the exercise of power". This informal, loyalty-based structure, which he controls absolutely, makes it nearly impossible for any potential rival to build a competing power base.

3. distribution - let others know.

Alignment: Strong. Putin is a master of propaganda, or "distribution." One of his first and most important acts as president was to bring Russia's television networks, the main source of news for most citizens, under state control. This allowed the Kremlin to craft and distribute a carefully managed image of Putin as the strong, competent leader single-handedly restoring Russia's greatness. This control of the information space has been crucial to maintaining his high approval ratings and ensuring his political longevity.

How to Be Strong
1. low expectations, high energy - survival is a floor, physics is a ceiling.


Alignment: Mixed. Putin is known for his tremendous energy and work ethic, often working late into the night and delving into minute policy details. As a former intelligence officer, he operates with a pragmatic, almost cynical worldview, holding 

low expectations of the motives of other countries and individuals. However, this is contradicted by his geopolitical actions. His decision to invade Ukraine in 2022 was based on unrealistically 

high expectations of a swift victory and the belief that Ukrainian resistance would quickly crumble, a profound miscalculation that violated the "survival is a floor" principle.

2. focus on raw truth - build based on solid base.

Alignment: Contradictory. While Putin demands detailed briefings, the book argues that he has increasingly become a victim of his own system. Over the years, he has constructed an echo chamber where he is fed information that conforms to his own worldview. Short writes that Putin's "convictions were so strong that he was liable to disregard any information that did not fit them". This led him to base the 2022 invasion not on the "raw truth" of Ukrainian national identity and military capability, but on a "faulty analysis" built on his own historical grievances and flawed intelligence.

3. welcome reality - allow mistakes, failures, ignorance, imperfection...

Alignment: Contradictory. This is Putin's greatest weakness, according to the biography. He consistently fails to "welcome reality" when it clashes with his strategic goals. When the initial "special military operation" in Ukraine failed to take Kyiv, he did not reassess his objectives. Instead, he doubled down, ordering a partial mobilization and blaming the failure on the West's intervention rather than his own strategic mistakes. The book portrays a leader who, over time, has become less able to process failure and adapt, instead choosing to "insist on his own version of reality," a trait that has proven to be his most dangerous.


Георги Константинович Жуков

Как делать дела
1. Создавать буфер — оставлять место для ошибок.

Соответствие: Сильное. Создание резервов было основой стратегии Жукова. Он понимал, что в войне неизбежны ошибки и неожиданности, и всегда настаивал на формировании мощных буферов. При планировании контрнаступления под 

Сталинградом он пишет: «Ставка согласилась с нашим предложением о создании мощных стратегических резервов, без которых нельзя было и думать о переходе в контрнаступление». Эти резервы, скрытно накопленные и введенные в бой в нужный момент, стали решающим фактором в окружении 6-й армии Паулюса. Он постоянно боролся за сохранение и пополнение резервов, считая их главным инструментом Верховного Главнокомандования.

2. Фокусироваться на рычагах — 10% переменных влияют на 90%.

Соответствие: Сильное. Все военное искусство Жукова было построено на поиске и использовании решающего «рычага» — направления главного удара. Он был мастером концентрации сил и средств на узком участке фронта для прорыва обороны противника, что влекло за собой развал всего его фронта. При планировании 

Берлинской операции он описывает создание подавляющего превосходства: «На участках прорыва фронтов создавалась невиданная в истории войн плотность сил и средств... Это позволяло взламывать любую оборону противника». Сосредоточив тысячи орудий, танков и самолетов на главном направлении, он добивался эффекта, когда один мощный удар решал исход всей операции.

3. Итерировать с обратной связью — вы строите то, что измеряете.

Соответствие: Сильное. Жуков не терпел планов, оторванных от реальности. Он постоянно требовал свежие разведданные и лично выезжал на передовую для оценки обстановки. Эта «обратная связь» с полем боя была для него ключевой. Во время битвы за Москву, когда ситуация менялась ежечасно, он постоянно корректировал действия войск. Он вспоминает: «Приходилось, изучая обстановку, немедленно принимать решения и отдавать короткие боевые распоряжения». Он не следовал догме, а постоянно «измерял» реальное положение дел и на его основе принимал решения, даже если они шли вразрез с первоначальным замыслом.

Как совершать прорывы
1. Правильная проблема — мышление в стиле «если это решить, результат будет огромным».

Соответствие: Сильное. Ставка (Верховное Главнокомандование) использовала Жукова для решения самых масштабных и критических проблем войны. Его не отправляли на второстепенные участки. Его задачами были: остановить немцев под Ленинградом и Москвой, организовать разгром под Сталинградом и на Курской дуге, провести операцию «Багратион» и, наконец, взять Берлин. Каждая из этих операций была «правильной проблемой», решение которой коренным образом меняло стратегическую ситуацию на всем советско-германском фронте.

2. p = f/a — концентрированная энергия.

Соответствие: Сильное. Эта формула идеально описывает тактический почерк Жукова. Он был сторонником массированного применения силы на решающем направлении. Начало 

Берлинской операции — хрестоматийный пример: «В 5 часов утра 16 апреля... тысячи орудий и минометов открыли огонь... В атаку ринулись танковые и пехотные массы, поддержанные мощным огнем артиллерии». Этот метод — создание огромной плотности огня и войск на узком участке (малая площадь 'a') для приложения сокрушительной силы ('F') — был его визитной карточкой, позволявшей проламывать самую сильную оборону.

3. Устойчивость — выжить достаточно долго, чтобы увидеть результаты.

Соответствие: Сильное. Вся карьера Жукова — это пример колоссальной устойчивости. Он пережил чистки в армии в 1937-1938 годах, устоял в самые тяжелые дни поражений 1941 года, выдерживал огромное давление со стороны Сталина. В критические дни обороны Москвы, когда враг был на пороге столицы, он проявил невероятную стойкость. Он вспоминает о разговоре со Сталиным: «Я ответил, что мы столицу не сдадим... Мы будем стоять насмерть». Эта способность выстоять в отчаянных ситуациях и дала ему возможность дожить до победных результатов 1945 года.

Как быть богатым (в контексте власти и успеха)
1. Больше, дешевле, проще — привлекает больше людей.

Соответствие: Умеренное. Этот принцип отражает саму суть советской военной машины, которую Жуков эффективно использовал. Он делал ставку на массовость («больше»). Советская военная техника, например танк Т-34, была спроектирована так, чтобы быть простой в производстве и ремонте, что позволяло выпускать ее в огромных количествах («дешевле» в масштабе). Жуков был мастером использования именно этой массовой, простой и надежной силы, что и привлекало на его сторону ресурсы всей страны.

2. Трудно скопировать — замедляет соперников.

Соответствие: Сильное. Уникальное сочетание личных качеств Жукова, его оперативного гения и особого положения при Сталине было невозможно скопировать. Он был одним из немногих, кто мог прямо спорить с Верховным и отстаивать свою точку зрения, что давало ему свободу действий, недоступную другим. Кроме того, сама советская система, способная выдерживать чудовищные потери и восстанавливать силы, была «трудна для копирования» для Германии, которая не могла восполнять ресурсы с такой же скоростью.

3. Распространение — дать знать другим.

Соответствие: Сильное. Жуков стал символом победы. Его имя «распространялось» по всем фронтам. Появление Жукова на любом критическом участке фронта поднимало боевой дух войск и вселяло уверенность в командование. Он был «пожарным» Ставки, и все знали: если приехал Жуков, значит, здесь будет наведен порядок. Кульминацией этого «распространения» стали два исторических акта: 

принятие безоговорочной капитуляции фашистской Германии в Карлсхорсте и 

принятие Парада Победы на Красной площади 24 июня 1945 года.

Как быть сильным
1. Низкие ожидания, высокая энергия — выживание это пол, физика это потолок.

Соответствие: Смешанное. «Высокая энергия» — это точное описание Жукова. Его мемуары полны свидетельств его круглосуточной работы без сна и отдыха. Однако «низкие ожидания» — более сложный аспект. С одной стороны, он был крайним реалистом и прагматиком. Он никогда не ждал легких побед и всегда готовился к худшему, к тяжелым боям и большим потерям — это можно считать формой «низких ожиданий». С другой стороны, он всегда имел высочайшие ожидания от себя, своих подчиненных и конечного результата — полной победы. Он не допускал мысли о поражении.

2. Фокусироваться на суровой правде — строить на прочном фундаменте.

Соответствие: Сильное. Это одна из самых сильных черт Жукова. Он был известен своей прямотой и даже резкостью, когда докладывал Сталину «суровую правду» об обстановке, даже если она была неприятной. Он категорически отвергал шапкозакидательство. Перед контрнаступлением под Москвой он настоял на отсрочке, доложив Ставке, что войска не готовы, хотя на него оказывалось давление. Он пишет: «Я считал своим долгом докладывать Верховному только объективные данные... Я не мог идти против своей совести и своего понимания обстановки». Его планы всегда строились на прочном фундаменте реальных данных.

3. Приветствовать реальность — позволять ошибкам, неудачам... и любым данным вносить коррективы.

Соответствие: Сильное. Жуков стал тем, кем он стал, именно потому, что умел «приветствовать реальность», какой бы ужасной она ни была. Летом и осенью 1941 года реальностью были катастрофические поражения. В отличие от многих, он не впал в отчаяние, а принял эту реальность и начал выстраивать оборону исходя из имеющихся, зачастую скудных, сил. Если наступление выдыхалось, он не бросал в бессмысленные атаки последние резервы, а признавал неудачу и переходил к обороне для накопления сил. Вся его деятельность в годы войны — это процесс адаптации к меняющейся реальности и принятия жестких, но необходимых решений на основе объективных данных.
