this interaction had:

no negotiation
no emotional performance required from me
no future claims attached
no identity entanglement

it solved a real problem quickly and disappeared.

power is the ability to produce results without excess complexity.

transactional relationships are beautiful because they are efficient. anything efficient is beautiful and powerful at the same time. society did a great job of bloating the idea of “genuine” relationships between everyone, whether friends, family, or partners. it is easier to make money than to maintain strong bonds as money is modular, bonds are stateful.

i mean, if it feels the same and if it is efficient enough not to distract you from work, i think transactional ones are superior because they are clear, simple, predictable and most importantly efficient.
